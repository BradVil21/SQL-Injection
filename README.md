[Introduction: This repository aims to analyze, detect, and prevent SQL injection attacks within web applications. By integrating detection mechanisms into an existing web environment, we can monitor for suspicious SQL injection activity, log attacks in real time, and implement preventive measures to safeguard sensitive data. The primary goal is to recognize potential SQL injection attacks as early as possible, allowing for swift remediation.]

<b>STEP 1</b><br>
While working through this alert, it is important to track what the alert has provided. <b>What should I do first?</b> Well good question. If you head to <b>"CASE PLAYBOOK"</b>, you are provided with details on what you should check for. Examine the rule name. Rule names are usually created specifically for the attack to be detected. By examining the rule name, you can understand which attack you are facing. Detect between which two devices the traffic is occurring. It's a good starting point to understand the situation by learning about the direction of traffic, what protocol is used between devices, etc. Here is the collection data for this alert: <br><br>
Ownership of the IP addresses and devices.<br>
If the traffic is coming from outside (Internet)<br>
Ownership of IP address (Static or Pool Address? Who owns it? Is it web hosting?)<br>
Reputation of IP Address (Search in VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Cisco Talos)<br>
If the traffic is coming from the company network;<br>
The hostname of the device<br>
Who owns the device (username)<br>
Last user logon time<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 2</b><br>
Now that I have identified what alert I'm facing, it is important to examine the traffic for any suspicious conditions regarding the web attack payloads. Since attackers do not only attack through URLs, it is mandatory to do my due diligence and examine all of the data to determine if there is a cyber attack. I will now decide whether or not this alert is malicious based on my investigation.<br>

<b>Provided URL:</b> https://172.16.17.18/search/?q=%22%20OR%201%20%3D%201%20--%20-
<br>
If I was to insert this URL within "VirusTotal", I would get results of this link not being malicious. But if you take a closer look at the link, some patterns indicate a possible SQL injection. I went ahead and utilized a URL decoder/encoder called <a href="https://www.urldecoder.org/">URL Decode and Encode</a>. After importing the URL link into the decoder, the results came back as a suspicious injection. <br><b>Results:</b> (https://172.16.17.18/search/?q=" OR 1 = 1 -- -).<br> <b>Attack Type:</b> SQL Injection <br> 

<b>STEP 3</b><br>
After identifying the attack type, it is also important to check if this is a planned test. Why check if this is a planned test? Well, to answer your question, penetration tests or attack simulations can trigger False Positive alarms if the rules are not set correctly.
<br>
<b>Objective:</b>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Check if there is an email showing that there will be planned work by searching for information such as hostname, username, IP address on the mailbox.</li>
  <li>Check if the device generating malicious traffic belongs to attack simulation products. If the Hostname contains the name of Attack Simulation products (such as Verodin, AttackIQ, Picusâ€¦), these devices belong to Attack Simulation products within the framework of LetsDefend simulation and it is a planned work.</li>
</ul>
